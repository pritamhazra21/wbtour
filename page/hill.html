        Surrounded by infinite slopes of emerald-green tea plantations and set against a backdrop of jagged white Himalayan peaks, Darjeeling is nestled away in the northern regions of West Bengal. A journey on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway fondly known as the ‘Toy train’ is a great way to explore and soak in the magnificent surroundings of this hill station. Top sightseeing spots: Tiger Hill, Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, Batasia Loop, Japanese Peace Pagoda, Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Observatory Hill, Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park and Rock Garden. For how long: Explore Darjeeling in 3-4 days. How to reach: Bagdogra is the nearest airport to Darjeeling. It is located about 95 kilometres away from the city. Direct flights from the cities like Kolkata, New Delhi and Guwahati operate to and fro Darjeeling. Taxis are easily available outside the airport to reach Darjeeling, and it normally takes 3 hours to reach the destination.
